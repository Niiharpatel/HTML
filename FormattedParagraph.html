            Python </abbr> is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different
        programs and isnâ€™t specialized for any specific problems.This versatility, along with its
        beginner-friendliness,
        has made it <u> <i> one of the most-used programming languages today.</i></u> A survey conducted by industry
        analyst
        firm
        <mark>RedMonk</mark>
        found that it was the second-most popular programming language among developers in 2021.Python has a simple
        syntax similar to the English language. <b>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer
            lines than some other programming languages.</b> Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can
        be
        executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
